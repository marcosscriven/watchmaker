# Watchmaker

## Caveats
* This is not associated with Garmin, just a little project for my own interest
* Takes a few minutes to build, but you can go to another tab in your browser while it does so. Will automatically save when finished
* Text sizes are only approximate for the dynamic data, as the watch itself draws those


## How to use it

* Upon loading a default watch face is there
* You can either just hit 'File -> Build watchface', or hit 'File-New' and start from scratch
* You can add new dynamic elements by clicking the watch icon on the bottom left, then on the cavas. You can choose the data (and size) from the presets on the top right
* Colours are selected from the palette on the bottom left, or from the icon above the watch icon.
* You can change the 'template' text manually on the right to be any combination of the presets. There's also printf-style formatting.
